# IronKaggle mini project

The very first ML project during IronHack Data science and Machine learning bootcamp.
Uses the dataset [House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/minasameh55/king-country-houses-aa).

## Requirements

The project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to handle python dependencies and Nix flake to handle the rest.
If you have [Nix](https://nixos.org/) then `nix develop` will create working environment.
