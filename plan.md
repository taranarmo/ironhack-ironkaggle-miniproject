## Plan

1. Load the dataset.
1. Explore the data to understand its structure — features, target variable, shape, and data types.
1. Clean the dataset (handle duplicates, missing values, etc.).
1. Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y).
1. Explore correlations between the target and features, and among features. Include your interpretations.
1. Handle categorical variables (encoding).
1. Train baseline models such as Linear Regression and KNN Regressor.
1. Evaluate the models using metrics like R² and MSE.
1. Improve your models:
    - Data side: handle outliers, multicollinearity, feature selection, normalization/standardization, feature engineering, etc.
    - Model side: try other models (especially ensemble methods) and perform hyperparameter tuning.
1. Compare all models and select the best one.
1. Identify which features most strongly influence house prices based on your best model.

## Deliverables

- A Jupyter Notebook containing all analysis, code, and results.
- A Presentation (10 minutes) summarizing your ML process, insights, and final model.
- A README file explaining your workflow, reasoning, and key decisions.

## Presentation Details

- All team members must present.
- Order: Groups 1 → 6
- Date & Time: Friday at 11:00
- After your presentation: use Friday afternoon to finalize your README, clean up your notebook, and submit your project by end of day.
